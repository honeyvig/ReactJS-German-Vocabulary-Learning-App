-----------
Creating a German vocabulary learning app with native video support, audio pronunciation, spaced repetition, and gamification requires a solid architecture. Given your requirements and budget, I recommend React Native as the primary framework, along with Firebase for backend services. React Native provides a fast way to build a cross-platform app (iOS & Android), and Firebase offers quick scalability for the backend, especially with features like real-time databases, user authentication, and storage.
Tech Stack Recommendation:

    Frontend: React Native (cross-platform iOS/Android)
    Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Storage, Authentication)
    Audio Pronunciation: Native audio files (MP3 or WAV) or Google Text-to-Speech API for pronunciation.
    Video: Firebase Storage (for video uploads) + a React Native Video library (for video playback).
    Spaced Repetition System: Use a custom algorithm or a library like Anki to track vocabulary review.
    Gamification: Implement using React Native’s state management (e.g., Redux) to track streaks, achievements, and badges.
    Offline Mode: Firebase's offline capabilities (Firestore offline persistence) or SQLite for local storage.

App Development Plan & Features Breakdown
1. Flashcards with Audio Pronunciation

Flashcards are the core feature of the app. You’ll display the word in the front, and users can flip it to see the meaning or translation. To add the audio pronunciation, you can either store audio files directly in Firebase Storage or use a Text-to-Speech API like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.
Example Code for Flashcard Component (React Native):

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity, Image } from 'react-native';
import { Audio } from 'expo-av'; // Use Expo's Audio API to play the sound

const Flashcard = ({ word, translation, audioUrl }) => {
  const [sound, setSound] = useState();
  const [showTranslation, setShowTranslation] = useState(false);

  const playAudio = async () => {
    const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(
      { uri: audioUrl }, 
      { shouldPlay: true }
    );
    setSound(sound);
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={playAudio}>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 30, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>{word}</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>

      {showTranslation ? (
        <Text style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>{translation}</Text>
      ) : (
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setShowTranslation(true)}>
          <Text style={{ color: 'blue' }}>Show Translation</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

export default Flashcard;

    playAudio(): Plays the pronunciation using the URL of the audio file stored on Firebase.
    Flashcard UI: Tapping the word plays the audio. Tapping again shows the translation.

2. Native Video Support

Each vocabulary word can have an optional video explanation. Videos are uploaded to Firebase Storage, and you can use React Native Video to embed them into the app.
Example Code for Video Playback:

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';
import Video from 'react-native-video';

const VideoPlayer = ({ videoUrl }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Video 
        source={{ uri: videoUrl }} 
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 250 }}
        controls={true}
        resizeMode="contain"
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const VocabularyWord = ({ word, videoUrl }) => {
  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 20, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>{word}</Text>
      {videoUrl && <VideoPlayer videoUrl={videoUrl} />}
    </View>
  );
};

export default VocabularyWord;

    VideoPlayer Component: Displays a video for the vocabulary word using the react-native-video library.
    VocabularyWord: Conditionally renders the video if a URL is provided.

3. Spaced Repetition System (SRS)

For spaced repetition, you can either implement a custom algorithm or use an existing one. Anki’s algorithm is widely used and can be adapted in JavaScript. It calculates the optimal time to review each flashcard based on the learner’s past performance.

Here’s a basic structure of how spaced repetition works:

const calculateNextReviewTime = (card) => {
  const currentTime = Date.now();
  const interval = card.repetitionInterval || 1; // Initial interval, can be adjusted
  const nextReviewTime = currentTime + interval * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // In days
  return nextReviewTime;
};

const updateReviewState = (card, isCorrect) => {
  if (isCorrect) {
    card.repetitionInterval *= 2; // Increase interval for correct answers
  } else {
    card.repetitionInterval = 1; // Reset interval for incorrect answers
  }
  card.lastReviewed = Date.now();
  card.nextReview = calculateNextReviewTime(card);
};

    Interval Calculation: Review times will increase based on correct answers and decrease on incorrect answers.
    Update logic: For each flashcard, update its nextReview time based on the learner’s progress.

4. Progress Tracking & Review System

You can store progress data (which words were learned, which need review) in Firebase Firestore. A simple structure could look like this:

users/{userId}/progress/{wordId} {
  learned: true/false,
  nextReviewTime: timestamp,
  streak: number
}

5. Gamification Elements

Gamification can include streaks, badges, and achievements. You can track these using Firebase Firestore and update the UI with user progress.

// Example of displaying streaks and achievements
const UserProfile = ({ streak, badges }) => (
  <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
    <Text>Streak: {streak} days</Text>
    <Text>Badges: {badges.join(', ')}</Text>
  </View>
);

6. Quizzes & Self-Testing Mode

Simple quizzes can be implemented with random flashcards. After each quiz, users will see their score and have the opportunity to review incorrect answers.

const Quiz = ({ wordList }) => {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);

  const checkAnswer = (answer) => {
    if (answer === wordList[currentIndex].translation) {
      setScore(score + 1);
    }
    setCurrentIndex(currentIndex + 1);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Question: {wordList[currentIndex].word}</Text>
      <TextInput 
        placeholder="Type your answer"
        onSubmitEditing={(e) => checkAnswer(e.nativeEvent.text)}
      />
      <Text>Score: {score}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

7. Offline Mode

To implement offline mode, Firestore supports offline persistence. You can enable it in your Firebase configuration:

import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore, enableIndexedDbPersistence } from 'firebase/firestore';

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);

enableIndexedDbPersistence(db)
  .catch((err) => {
    if (err.code === 'failed-precondition') {
      console.log('Multiple tabs open');
    } else if (err.code === 'unimplemented') {
      console.log('This browser does not support offline data');
    }
  });
